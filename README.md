During this study, a total of 249 mice with SCC tumors were selected to participate. These mice were treated with various drug regimens to assess their effects on tumor development. The study spanned 45 days, during which the progression of tumors was closely observed and measured.

The main focus of this research was to compare the performance of a specific drug of interest, Capomulin, with the outcomes of the other treatment regimens used. This comparison aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of Capomulin in reducing tumor growth in comparison to the alternative treatments.

By analyzing and comparing the data from this study, researchers aimed to gain valuable insights into the potential benefits of Capomulin and its ability to combat SCC tumors. The findings from this study could contribute to a better understanding of effective treatment options and potentially lead to improved therapies for SCC tumors.

I perferomed the following to gain insights...

-Prepared the data.

-Generated summary statistics.

-Created bar charts and pie charts.

-Calculated quartiles, find outliers, and create a box plot.

-Created a line plot and a scatter plot.

-Calculated correlation and regression.

-Full analysis listed at the top of the files

I used 2 data CSV files inside the data folder to gather my conclusions and my work can be found in the pymaceuticals.ipynb file.
